# README

js10 - A game about combining tiles/cells of similiar numbers into the next higher number.

I first came across this in an iPad game called "10" (or so, forgot), and it was quite addictive. It also had a pretty nice looking, yet simple UI, which I liked. Here I try to just implement the general gameplay in a variety of compile-to-JavaScript languages and frameworks. Or so.


And yeah, I used tabs. I honestly don't care much about spaces vs tabs, just be consistent. Or not. I am not the police, and this is just a README file.

# Project status: abandoned | on indefinite hiatus

I wanted to implement this game in a variety of languages and frameworks, but I lost interest after doing the ES6 version.
If I ever get back to this project, I'll give ClojureScript or Elm or any of the other compiles-to-js languages a try. But for now this project is on a hiatus. 


The implementations are not bug-free, but at this point I don't want to dive deeper to fix those as I want to concentrate on other, more fun projects. If you want to, feel free to fix the bugs and send a pull request.


React version: if I ever have time to do this, it would work like a combination of the vanilla JS and the ES6 version, i.e. using DIVs for display, but using the game logic from the ES6 version.
