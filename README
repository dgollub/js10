js10 - A game about combining tiles/cells of similiar numbers into the next higher number.

I first came across this in an iPad game called "10" (or so, forgot), and it was quite addictive. It also had a pretty nice looking, yet simple UI, which I liked. Here I try to just implement the general gameplay in a variety of compile-to-JavaScript languages and frameworks. Or so.
